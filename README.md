# COVID-19-Analysis

Up until January 2020, most people have never heard of the coronavirus, formally known as COVID-19. Due to its contagious nature, the virus has spread like wildfire across the globe, affecting many in terms of health, work, and stability. For this project, we decided to tackle the COVID-19 dataset in order to predict the total number of confirmed cases and fatalities in the United States. This project also aims to explore COVID-19 through data analysis, projections, and visualizations. Three different models - linear regression, logistic regression, and lasso regression - were evaluated. In the end, the best model, which was linear regression, was able to predict the total number of confirmed cases and deaths with 100% and 100% accuracy, respectively, for the training set. In terms of performance on the validation set, it was able to predict the total number of confirmed cases and deaths with 99.99% and 99.98% accuracy, respectively.
